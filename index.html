            <p>
                Seasoned Studio Director, Technical Director, and Senior Lead Programmer with a proven history of guiding expert engineering teams and successfully delivering both enterprise solutions and high-quality, cross-platform games on PC, console, VR, and mobile platforms. Leveraging a strong background in software development and engineering management, I excel in applying C# and OOP, advanced data structures & algorithms, performance optimisation techniques, networking solutions, and multi-threaded programming to create scalable, modular, and event-driven architectures.  <br/><br/>
                With a background in game design and art and a proven record of technical evangelism through university lectures and industry keynotes—most recently a keynote at the 2024 Games Conference at Griffith—I bring a well-rounded perspective that bridges creativity and engineering insight. <br/><br/>
                Over 8 years of operating my own game studio, along with founding two previous companies, have honed my ability to align technical vision with business goals, ensure seamless integration of design patterns and object-oriented principles, and adopt modern game engines, CI/CD tools, and Agile/Scrum methodologies. I thrive on fostering collaborative cultures, maintaining clear communication at all organisational levels, and continuously staying ahead of industry trends and best practices.
